### Projects

**AI in robotics**
*Imagine a robotic arm in a factory. It's not just repeating a pre-programmed motion. Instead, it's using computer vision to identify different components on a conveyor belt, making real-time adjustments to its grip and movement to pick up each one accurately. The image would show the robot's arm, a camera as its "eye," and a user interface displaying the objects it's identifying. The overall scene would suggest a blend of physical machinery and intelligent, data-driven decision-making.*

**AI in Modern IT**
Visualize a complex web of interconnected data points, lines, and nodes, symbolizing a large dataset. At the center of this web, there is a glowing, neural network-like structure that is processing the data. Surrounding this central core are various applications and interfacesâ€”a smart assistant on a smartphone, an e-commerce recommendation engine with product suggestions, and a financial dashboard predicting market trends. The image would highlight how AI is the "brain" powering a wide range of modern software applications.*
